{"name":"Acoino","tagline":"a different type of exchange media","body":"### What is the difference?\r\n1. Unlike any other trading methods, acoino itself is just a trading media with zero value in it. So it cannot be traded with any form of real (or digital) currency. Otherwise, you can buy infinite amount of acoinos with $0 in theory.\r\n2. Acoino is of two types: acoino and antiacoino. Each of them cannot be created separately. They are always created and annihilated in pairs.\r\n","google":"UA-74200443-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
